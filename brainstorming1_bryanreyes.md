# Project Milestone #1 - **Brainstorming**

## App 1: *SoFi Banking*

- For each banking service they provide, they have unique UI and functions that distinguishes the different services you may be using.
- The color scheme/typography is uniform across the app and the experience on the app makes it seem like you are a banking expert by showing you real time data from stocks, etc.
- The privacy of the app is another notable feature that I enjoy. For example, if you swipe to another app, the SoFi app puts up a screen on their app to protect the privacy of the user.

## App 2: *Airbuds*

- By grabbing users' music streaming data, the app presents a social media feed of songs that other users are enjoying in real time.
- The app allows users to react to your songs with emojis or custom stickers which could be app-owned or user created in the app.
- The Q&A feature is also intriguing as it allows users to pose a question ("What song makes you feel nostalgic?") and other users respond with a song ("The Sweet Escape by Gwen Stefani").

## App 3: *Shop*

- By using users' information from email, the app is able to track orders from order confirmation emails. It is like a one-stop place to see where all your deliveries are when you go rogue on an online-shopping spree!
- In the feed page, based on past orders or accounts that you follow in the app, you get recommendations for other items you may be interested in purchasing.
- You are also able to search for items and the app scrapes the internet for related items you may be looking for. It also of course leads you to the product's page so that you can purchase it.
